            “Joker” centers around the iconic arch-nemesis and is an original, standalone story not seen before on the big screen. 
            The exploration of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a man disregarded by society, is not only a gritty character study, 
            but also a broader cautionary tale.
